You are thinking "Why yet another Make-clone tool?"

Because Make is limited and FoBiS is not a simple Make-clone!

+ Make has one of the worst syntax ever designed (these are spaces or tab?!?);
+ Make is not intuitive, it has so many implicit rules;
+ Make cannot automatically build modern Fortran projects using interdependent modules!

From Fortran90 we have a great feature: modules! Modules are great, but they introduce a compiling-cascade-hierarchy.

FoBiS has been developed essentially to automatically resolve the compiling-cascade-hierarchy arising from (ab)use of modules, but FoBiS can do many cool things!
